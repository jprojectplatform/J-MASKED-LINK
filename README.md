#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

#### Step-by-Step Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jprojectplatform/J-MASKED-LINK.git
   cd J-MASKED-LINK
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

1. **Download Pre-built Executable**
   - Visit [J-Wrapper Releases](https://github.com/jprojectplatform/J-Wrapper/releases)
   - Download the latest `J-Masked-Link.exe`
   - Run directly - no installation required

2. **Build Your Own Executable**
   ```bash
   # Clone J-Wrapper
   git clone https://github.com/jprojectplatform/J-Wrapper.git
   
   # Build J Masked Link
   python j-wrapper.py --input j-masked.py --output J-Masked-Link.exe --icon icon.ico
   ```

#### J-Wrapper Benefits

## 🎮 Usage Guide

### Basic Workflow

1. **Enter Target URL**
   - Input the destination URL you want to mask
   - Example: `https://your-target-site.com`

2. **Set Custom Domain**
   - Choose a convincing domain for masking
   - Example: `gmail.com`, `facebook.com`, `microsoft.com`

3. **Add Security Keywords**
   - Include relevant keywords separated by commas
   - Example: `login, verify, security, update`

4. **Generate URLs**
   - Click "GENERATE MASKED URLS" to create links across all services
   - Monitor progress in real-time

5. **Copy & Use**
   - Click "COPY URL" on any successful generation
   - Use the masked URLs as needed

### Output Format
Generated URLs follow this pattern:
```
https://[custom-domain]-[keywords]@[service-domain]/[short-code]
```

Example:
```
https://gmail.com-login-verify-security@tinyurl.com/abc123
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New Services
Extend the application by adding new shortener services:

```python
def shorten_newservice(self, url):
    """Shorten URL using NewService"""
    try:
        api_url = "https://newservice.com/api"
        payload = {"url": url}
        response = requests.post(api_url, json=payload, timeout=10)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return response.json().get('short_url')
        return None
    except:
        return None
```

### Theme Customization
Modify colors in the `themes` dictionary:
```python
self.themes = {
    'dark': {
        'bg': '#0f0f23',
        'fg': '#e0e0e0',
        'accent': '#ff6b9d',
        # ... more colors
    }
}
```

### Building Custom Executables
Use J-Wrapper to create specialized builds:

```bash
# Basic build
python j-wrapper.py --input j-masked.py --output MyMaskedLink.exe

# Build with custom icon
python j-wrapper.py --input j-masked.py --output J-Masked-Link.exe --icon custom.ico

# Build with console window (for debugging)
python j-wrapper.py --input j-masked.py --output J-Masked-Link.exe --console
```
